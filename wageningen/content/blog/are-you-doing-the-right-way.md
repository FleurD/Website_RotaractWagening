Tour de RAC is an auto-orientation tour in which about 70 vintage cars participate every year. During this event we provide a full-day program, where we give the car enthusiast a wonderful day. Through the now notorious ball-arrow system, the teams follow the route and see the beautiful places of Maastricht and surroundings.
