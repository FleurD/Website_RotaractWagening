The Santa Run is a 3 km long fun run for the whole family. All participants walk dressed as Santa Claus a simple and enjoyable course. The relatively short course makes the run very suitable for both young and old, but also for people in wheelchairs, parents with prams or owners with their dogs. The proceeds of the Santa Run 2018 go to Stichting Help Elkaar in Geldermalsen. A local goal that works with heart and soul for people who have virtually nothing to spend. These people can often just pay for their plate of food, but have no money for new clothes or an outing. At Stichting Help Elkaar Geldermalsen they can shop for free to make their lives a little more human. In addition, they organize numerous activities for young and old and emphasize the value of social contact.
